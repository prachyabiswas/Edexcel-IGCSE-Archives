What is a Programming Language?
A programming language is a way for people to tell computers what to do. But computers only understand special codes called machine code (which looks like a bunch of 1s and 0s).

Key Objectives in Understanding Programming Languages:
i)Understanding high-level vs low-level programming languages.
ii)Understanding what assemblers, compilers, and interpreters do when translating programming languages into machine code.
iii)Recognizing the advantages and disadvantages of different translation methods (compilers, interpreters).


Topic:Low-Level Programming Languages (e.g., Assembly and Machine Code)
Machine Code:
Machine code is the lowest level of programming. It’s just 1s and 0s (binary code), like:
                             01010101 10101010 11110000
Computers can understand machine code, but it’s too hard for humans to read or write directly.
