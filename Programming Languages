What is a Programming Language?
A programming language is a way for people to tell computers what to do. But computers only understand special codes called machine code (which looks like a bunch of 1s and 0s).

Key Objectives in Understanding Programming Languages:
i)Understanding high-level vs low-level programming languages.
ii)Understanding what assemblers, compilers, and interpreters do when translating programming languages into machine code.
iii)Recognizing the advantages and disadvantages of different translation methods (compilers, interpreters).


Topic:Low-Level Programming Languages (e.g., Assembly and Machine Code)
Machine Code:
Machine code is the lowest level of programming. It’s just 1s and 0s (binary code), like:
                             01010101 10101010 11110000
Computers can understand machine code, but it’s too hard for humans to read or write directly.

Assembly Language:
Assembly language is a step up from machine code. It uses short words or mnemonics (like MOV or ADD) that are easier to understand than just 1s and 0s.
Example in Assembly language:
        MOV AX, 5   ; This means: move the number 5 into the AX register
        ADD AX, 3   ; This means: add 3 to the value in the AX register
But even Assembly language still needs to be converted into machine code by a special program called an assembler.


So Why Use Low-Level Language?
Advantages:
Easier to write and read.
Portable: Can run on different machines.

Disadvantages:
Slower than low-level languages (need translation into machine code).


Compilers and Interpreters: How Code Gets Translated
Compiler:
Definition: A program that translates the entire source code into machine code at once.
Output: An executable file that can run without needing the source code again.
Pros:
i)Faster execution after compilation.
ii)No need for source code once compiled.
Example: C, C++.

Interpreter:
Definition: A program that translates and runs the source code line by line.
Output: Executes code directly, no executable file is produced.
Pros:
Easier for debugging.
Cons:
i)Slower execution since it translates code line by line.
ii)Requires source code to be available every time.
Example: Python, JavaScript.


Comparison of Low-Level and High-Level Languages:
Low-Level Languages:
Faster because they directly control the machine.
Harder to write and understand.

High-Level Languages:
Easier to write and understand.
Slower because they have to be translated into machine code first.

Examples:
Example 1: Low-Level vs High-Level Language (O-Level Question)
Question: Explain the difference between low-level and high-level programming languages.
Answer:
i)Low-level languages are very fast and allow complete control over the computer's hardware. But they are difficult to understand and write.
ii)High-level languages are easier for humans to write and understand but are slower to run because they need to be translated into machine code first.

Example 2: Compiler vs Interpreter (O-Level Question)
Question: What is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter?
Answer:
i)A compiler translates the entire program into machine code before running it, and you get an executable file to run later.
ii)An interpreter translates and runs the program line by line, so you need the source code each time you run the program, and it runs slower.



Compilers vs Interpreters:
| Feature          | **Compiler**                               | **Interpreter**                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Translation Type | Translates the entire program at once      | Translates and executes line-by-line |
| Output           | Generates an executable file               | Executes directly, no file generated |
| Speed            | Faster execution after compiling           | Slower execution                     |
| Error Handling   | Errors reported after full program compile | Stops at each error during execution |

Why Use Compilers?
Efficiency: Once a program is compiled, it can run faster because the machine code is directly executed by the CPU.
Security: Since the source code is not exposed, it is harder to copy or modify the program.

O-Level Example:
Question: Why would a software company use a compiler to distribute a program to the public?
Answer:
A compiler creates a compiled version of the program that can be run on any compatible machine, making the program portable.
The source code remains hidden, making it secure from copying.


Why Use Interpreters?
Ease of Debugging: Since interpreters execute the code line-by-line, errors are easier to locate because the program stops when an error occurs.
Immediate Feedback: As the interpreter translates each line, the program runs instantly, which is great for testing small code snippets.


Writing Programs in Assembly Language
Challenges:
1)Limited Instructions: Only a few basic commands available (e.g., ADD, MOV).
2)Memory Management: You must handle memory and data storage manually.
3)Debugging: It is difficult to debug and errors might cause the system to crash.

O-Level Example:
Question: What are the advantages and disadvantages of using Assembly language over high-level languages?
Answer:
Advantages: Assembly provides better control over hardware, allowing efficient programs.
Disadvantages: Harder to write and debug.


Activity 25: Graphical vs Textual Languages
Graphical Programming: Used in visual programming languages like Scratch. These are intuitive and easy for beginners to start coding.
Example: In Scratch, you use blocks to represent code and "snap" them together, making it a great choice for those new to programming.

Textual Programming: Involves writing code in languages like Python or Java.
Example: Writing the statement print("Hello, World!") in Python is an example of textual programming.
